## Assignment 2 Questions

#### Directions
Please answer the following questions and submit in your repo for the second assignment.  Please keep the answers as short and concise as possible.

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application.   After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**:  I think that creating the get_student function was absolutely useful for the overall design of this database. This function allowed me to use it for other functions, such as add_student and del_student. get_student allowed me to check if a certain student already existed in the database, since if NO_ERROR was returned from get_student, this means that the student exists in the database. Additionally, if SRCH_NOT_FOUND was returned, this told me that the student doesn't exist in the database, which was very useful for functions like add_student and del_student that required me to initially check if a student already existed.

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** The above implementation returns the address of a local variable (student) if the student is found, and otherwise returns NULL. This is a bad implementation using the C programming language because once the function exits, this memory address is no longer valid, leading to unpredictable and unexpected behavior when trying to reference this address for anything else. The benefit in passing by reference in our original implementation is that the memory being returned and referenced is in relation to the student database pointer, rather than a local variable instide of get_student.

3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** This implementation avoids the error of the last implementation, in terms of the fact that the pointer that is returned if the student is found is going to remain valid after the function has been executed. Another benefit of this implementation is that the function doesn't have a parameter that is a pointer to storage like the original implementation of get_student. A potential downside of this function is that the person calling the function would be responsible for freeing the memory, leading to an increase of risk in memory leaks if free() isn't called. Additionally, allocating additional memory using malloc() may impact performance and cause this function to run slower than our original implementation.


4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** We stored the student records using an offset that was calculated by id * sizeof(student_t). Since the student ID's weren't sequential, the offset value was very different depending on the ID. This led to "holes"/"gaps" in the file, which made it appear larger than the actual amount of data stored. ls reports the file size including these holes, meaning that it appears that the file is much bigger than it actually is.

    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** This is because linux allocates disk storage in blocks, meaning that sprase files only take up disk space when a block is written. This means that IDs 1, 3, and 63 were stored in the same block, which can explain why the total storage remained unchanged for all of these. For ID=64, the block boundary was crossed, meaning that additional disk space was needed and another block was written, explaining the jump from 4K to 8K.

    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:**  The file size increased dramatically when using the ls command because the offset increased dramatically, since it is calculated by (id * sizeof(student_t)). Due to the way linux manages sparse files, the raw storage only increased to 12K because another block was written of 4K size, jumping from 8K to 12K. This is using the same reasoning as the answer to the last two questions, since ls describes the file size including the "holes" in space, while du describes the raw storage in relation to the 4K size blocks being written.
