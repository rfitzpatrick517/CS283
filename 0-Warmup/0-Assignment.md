#### Questions to Answer
Please provide answers to these questions using markdown notation and place them in the `\0-Warmup` directory in your git repository:

1. Select with an `x` the platform you will be using for your course deliverables:

    - [x] drexel's tux cluster
    - [ ] WSL on Windows
    - [ ] Orbstack on MacOs
    - [ ] VMWare Fusion

    - [ ] YES
    - [x] N/A - I plan to use tux

3. Please provide a link to the repository you are using for this class.

4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

I would like to come out of this class with a better understanding of the C language, as well as a much better understanding on how programs are actually compiled. At the moment, much of the compiling aspect of code
feels like "magic", so it would be nice to fully understand how this works to the level where I could explain it to others.

6. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

I would say that my main concern is that I feel extremely uncomfortable in C at the moment. I think I can get through this, however, but it may take me some extra time towards the start of the term to get adjusted.
